#Write a dictionary that uses a dictionary to assign ‘codes’to each letter of the alphabet. 
#For example:codes = {‘A’: ‘@’,‘a’: ‘9’, ‘B’:‘%’, ‘b’:‘#’, etc...}Using this example, the letter A would be assigned the symbol @, 
#the letter a would be assigned the number 9, the letter B would be assigneda symbol %, and so forth.
#The program should implement a function to input a sentence,then use the dictionary to write an encrypted version of the input and display it.
#Write a second function that takes the encryptedtext and displays its decrypted content
