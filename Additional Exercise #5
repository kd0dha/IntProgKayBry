#Many companies use telephone numbers like 555-GET-FOOD so the number is easier for customers to
#remember. On a standard telephone, the alphabetic letters are mapped to numbers in the following fashion:
#ABC = 2, DEF = 3, GHI = 4, JKL = 5, MNO = 6, PQRS = 7, TUV = 8, WXYZ = 9
#Write a program thar asks the user to enter a 10-character telephone number in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX
#The application should display the telephone number with any alphabetic characters that appeared
#in the original translated to their numeric equivalent. For example,
#555-GET-FOOD displays 555-438-3663
