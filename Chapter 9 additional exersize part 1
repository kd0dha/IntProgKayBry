1.Creating the CellPhone Class
Wireless Solutions, Inc. is a business that sells cell phones and wireless service. You
are a programmer in the company’s IT department, and your team is designing a
program to manage all of the cell phones that are in inventory. You have been asked
to design a class that represents a cell phone. The data that should be kept as
attributes in the class are as follows:
1. The name of the phone’s manufacturer will be assigned to the manufact attribute.
2. The phone’s model number will be assigned to the model attribute.
3. The phone’s retail price will be assigned to the retail_price attribute.
The class will also have the following methods:
• An __init__ method that accepts arguments for the manufacturer, model number,
and retail price.
• A set_manufact method that accepts an argument for the manufacturer. This
method will allow us to change the value of the manufact attribute after the object
has been created, if necessary.
• A set_model method that accepts an argument for the model. This method will
allow us to change the value of the model attribute after the object has been
created, if necessary.
• A set_retail_price method that accepts an argument for the retail price. This
method will allow us to change the value of the retail_price attribute after the
object has been created, if necessary.
• A get_manufact method that returns the phone’s manufacturer.
• A get_model method that returns the phone’s model number.
• A get_retail_price method that returns the phone’s retail price.
The CellPhone class will be imported into several programs that your team is developing. To
test the class, you write the code. This is a simple program that prompts the user for the
phone’s manufacturer, model number, and retail price. An instance of the CellPhone class is
created and the data is assigned to its attributes.
Sample Program Output (with input shown in bold)
