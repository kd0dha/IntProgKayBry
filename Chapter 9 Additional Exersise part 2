2. Employee Class: Write a class named Employee that holds the following data about an
employee in attributes: name, ID number, department, and job title. Once you have written
the class, write a program that creates three Employee objects to hold the following data:
Name ID Number Department Job Title
Susan Meyers 47899 Accounting Vice President
Mark Jones 39119 IT Programmer
Joy Rogers 81774 Manufacturing Engineer
The program should store this data in the three objects and then display the data for each
employee on the screen.

I CANT FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET IT TO COME OUT THE WAY IT SHOWS IN THE INSTRUCTIONS. THE ID AND DEPARTMENT ARE SWITCHED AND WHEN
I TRY TO FIX IT I GET AN ERROR MESSAGE:(
class Person:

    def __init__(self, name, ID, Department):
        self.Personname = name
        self.PersonID = ID
        self.PersonDepartment = Department 

    def __str__(self):
         return self.Personname+ " " + self.PersonDepartment+ ", " + str(self.PersonID)

class Employee(Person):

    def __init__(self, name, ID, Department, Title):
        super().__init__(name, ID, Department)

        self.StaffTitle = Title

    def __str__(self):
        return super().__str__() + ", " +  self.StaffTitle
