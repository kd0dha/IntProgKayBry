#the months with the highest and lowest amounts.Usea function to enter the data into the list, 
#use another function to calculate and display the statistics asked above.


def function_a(user_input):
  #FIXME: accept 12 months of inputs into a list
  print(rain_by_month)
  
def function_b()
  sum(rain_by_month)
  #FIXME: print average monthly rainfall (sum/len)
  #FIXME: print MAX rainfall of list
